# Privacy

- Data minimization: only target names/IPs and timing metrics stored.
- No payload capture. DNS qnames limited to configured synthetic test names.
- Optional passive capture (future) is OFF by default and will store only aggregates.
- Netlink monitoring records link/route change notifications without packet content.
- Bundles are local; user controls sharing.
